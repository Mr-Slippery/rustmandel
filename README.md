# rustmandel

Mandelbrot zoomer in Rust with Piston for graphics.

Recommend release build: `cargo run --release`

Controls:

* left/right-click to zoom;
* brackets to increase/decrease max iterations;
* M/J to switch to (M)andelbrot/(J)ulia;
* S to save the image to the current dir;
* left/right/up/down arrows for movement.

Learning Rust, so the code is very nascent probably.
Any comments welcome.

Enjoy the [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

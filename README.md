# rustmandel

Mandelbrot zoomer in Rust with Piston for graphics.

Recommend release build: `cargo run --release`

Controls: Left/right click to zoom, brackets to increase/decrease max iterations.

Learning Rust, so the code is very nascent probably.
Any comments welcome.

Enjoy the [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

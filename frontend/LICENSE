Whatever you do with this, you're on your own.

I may be inclined to help with issues or questions, but this code is in no way fit for anything other than playing around.
Even so, if it smokes your machine, or if aliens start pouring from the sky hunting for you, it's not my problem.

Otherwise feel free to fork/copy/change/distribute/take it out to dinner.
See if I care. (*)

Thank you for your understanding, much appreciated.

P.S. Yes, I know it's 3.1415. See (*) above.
